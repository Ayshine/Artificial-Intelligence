**Peter Norvig**
AI program is called **Intelligent Agent** just like **AlphaGo**

you can learn more about **AlphaGo** by watching the documentary and/or reading the paper

This repository is built to showcase completed classroom projects of Artificial Intelligence and Specializations Nanodegree offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

This README is broken down into the following sections:

- [Sudoku](#sudoku)
- [Isolation](#isolation)

- [Natural Language Processing Capstone](#natural-language-processing-capstone)
- [Voice User Interface Capstone](#voice-user-interface-capstone)

## Sudoku ##
In this project  we practiced two very important concepts of artificail intelligence, **constraint propagation** and **search**. We created  an **AI agent** that will solve any Sudoku puzzle.The algorithm fully used are based from the great [blogpost](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html) of Peter Norvig.
