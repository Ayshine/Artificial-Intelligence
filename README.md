*AI is really about unleashing one of the most amazing things in the entire universe, intelligence.* 
**Sebastian Thrun**
*AI is the discipline that deals with uncertainty and manages it in decision making*
**Peter Norvig**

**Artificial intelligence (AI)**, sometimes called *machine intelligence*, is intelligence demonstrated by machines.

This repository is built to showcase completed classroom projects of Artificial Intelligence and Specializations Nanodegree offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

This README is broken down into the following sections:

- [Sudoku](#sudoku)
- [Isolation](#isolation)
- [Planning](#planning)
- [Recognizer](#recognizer)
- [Computer Vision Capstone](#computer-vision-capstone)
- [Natural Language Processing Capstone](#natural-language-processing-capstone)
- [Voice User Interface Capstone](#voice-user-interface-capstone)
