AI program is called **Intelligent Agent** just like **AlphaGo**. You can learn more about **AlphaGo** by watching the documentary and/or reading the paper

## Sudoku ##
In this project  we practiced two very important concepts of artificial intelligence, **constraint propagation** and **search**. We created  an **AI agent** that will solve any Sudoku puzzle. In this project, The goals are to implement the **naked twins** function, and write an AI agent that will solve the **Diagonal Sudoku** game.The algorithm fully used are based from the great [blogpost](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html) of Peter Norvig. 

You can find more information about the implementation steps of this project on the project's own [README](/Sudoku/README.md) file. Also, You can visit the project's original [repository](https://github.com/udacity/aind-sudoku) for further information.

**My Solution**

- [Solution](Sudoku/solution.py)

## Isolation ##
In this project, we implemented 

- **minimax** search
- minimax search with **alpha-beta pruning**
- **iterative deepening** search
- our own best position evaluation heuristic
- our own alternate position evaluation heuristic
- our own alternate position evaluation heuristic

In the second part of this project we read a seminal paper in the field of Game-Playing and wrote a simple one page summary on it. In my case I read **AlphaGo** paper.

## Planning ##
In this project, we defined a group of problems in classical **PDDL** (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain discussed in the lectures.  then we set up the problems for **search**, experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including **planning graph heuristics**, to solve the problems, and then we provided an analysis of the results. Additionally, we wrote a short **research review pape**r on the historical development of **planning techniques** and their use in artificial intelligence.

## Recognizer ##
In this project, we built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). We were provided a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video. Our goal was to train a set of **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** using part of this dataset to try and identify individual words from test sequences.

As an optional challenge, we incorporated **Statistical Language Models (SLMs)** that capture the conditional probability of particular sequences of words occurring. This helped us improve the recognition accuracy of your system.

## Computer Vision Capstone ##
 In this project, we combinec our knowledge of **computer vision techniques** and **deep learning** to build and end-to-end **facial keypoint recognition** system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from **facial tracking** to **emotion recognition**. Our completed code can take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints.

## Natural Language Processing Capstone ##

In this project, you built a **deep neural network** that functions as part of an end-to-end **machine translation** pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

## Voice User Interface Capstone ##
In this project, we built a **deep neural network** that functions as part of an end-to-end **automatic speech recognition (ASR)** pipeline!

We begin by investigating the **LibriSpeech** dataset that will be used to train and evaluate our models. Our algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. Then we moved on to building **neural networks** that can map these audio features to transcribed text. After learning about the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR, we engaged in our own investigations by creating and testing our own state-of-the-art models.
